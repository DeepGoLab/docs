## DSP (Deep Sea Plankton)
Just as marine life requires nourishment to grow, DSP is one of the consumables required to upgrade the users' reputation NFTs in DeepGo metaverse. Users social and play to earn DSP, and get more efficiently as they upgrade NFTs.
â€‹

Notice:

- DeepGo does not sell DSP directly to users,
- DeepGo does not provide users with the liquidity of DSP,
- The DSP used for upgrading and minting NFT is destroyed directly.

For details about DSP consumption and acquisition values, see [Reputation NFT: Voyager](https://deepgolab.github.io/docs/docs/Reputation-NFT-Voyager).

### Declaration: 
The actual values of DSP consumption and acquisition are subject to the formal product settings. This value is set by DeepGo data scientists and updated with the iteration of our product.
