## DSP (Deep Sea Plankton)
Just as marine life requires nourishment to grow, the DSP is one of the consumables required to upgrade the users' reputation NFTs. Users participate in DeepGo activities to acquire DSP, and the more efficient they become as their NFTs upgrade.
â€‹

Minting or upgrading a Voyager requires a rated DGT and a DSP whose consumption increases with the Voyager level. The amount of DGT consumed is adjusted for variables in the economy. In addition:

- DeepGo does not sell DSP directly to users,
- DeepGo does not provide users with the liquidity of DSP.

For details about DSP consumption and acquisition values, see [Reputation NFT: Voyager](https://deepgolab.github.io/docs/docs/Reputation-NFT-Voyager).
