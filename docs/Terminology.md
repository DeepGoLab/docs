### Basic Concept
DGT: DeepGo Token.
### User Identities

- Initial Provider (IP): mainly for managers of projects which need liquidity. 
- Great Partner (GP): mainly for investors who prefer venture investment. 
- Limit Participant (LP): mainly for investors who prefer steady investment.
### Stages of Fund Pools
#### Auction Stage
At this stage,

- IPs who hold the same project tokens can bid DGT for the initiation right of the fund pool.
#### Building/Fundraising Stage
At this stage,

- IP can add the pledge to raise the fund pool size.
- GP pays the fee to subscribe for the fund pool share, the share allocated to GP is related to the amount of investment and held DGT. The system will automatically subscribe according to the share and return the excess funds. After deducting the subscription fee, the remaining funds will enter the fund pool and match with LP capital to provide liquidity for the pool project in DEX.
- LP can invest in the fund pool, the capital will be matched with GP capital, and then enter DEX to provide liquidity for the pool project.
#### Ongoing Stage
At this stage,

- IP can add the pledge and withdraw up to 80% of the vault (provided by GP) and the rest is for LP.
- GP can freely enter and exit the fund pool at any time.
- LP can freely enter and exit the fund pool at any time and extract returns.
#### Liquidation Stage
At this stage,

- IP's impawned Token would be unlocked and returned to the account.
- GP could redeem all maturing assets.
- LP could redeem all maturing assets.
