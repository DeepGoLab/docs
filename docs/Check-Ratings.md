## Rating Indicators
### Winning
Winning refers to the percentage of time in which Token returns exceed benchmark returns within the period. The higher the winning, the higher the rating.  
### Revenue
Revenue is mainly measured by annual percentage yield (APY). The higher the APY, the higher the rating.
### Efficiency
Investors all want a higher return for the same risk and less risk for the same return. The indicator is mainly measured by the ratio of excess investment return to risk. The higher the ratio, the higher the rating.
### Stability
Stability is mainly measured by annualized volatility. The more volatile the Token price is, the stronger the uncertainty of return is. The more flat the price volatility, the stronger the certainty of earnings. Thus, the lower the annualized volatility, the higher the rating.
### Drawdown
The drawdown is a peak-to-trough decline during a specific period for an investment. The maximum drawdown is an important risk indicator that represents the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of the investment before a new peak is attained. The smaller the maximum drawdown (we use the positive formula), the higher the rating.
### Sustainability
The indicator is mainly measured by the first-order autocorrelation coefficient of Token excess returns. If the coefficient is positive and larger, the sustainability of excess returns will be stronger. If this indicator is negative and smaller, the sustainability of excess returns is weaker. The higher the coefficient, the higher the rating.
