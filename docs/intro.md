The DeepGo ocean world is an on-chain meta-universe starting with ratings, strategy, and NFT features, followed by tranche fund and Launchpad capabilities to further expand the ecosystem.
## Early-Stage Product
### 1. Rating
DeepGo uses quantitative algorithms to comprehensively evaluate market projects based on winning, revenue, efficiency, stability, drawdown, and sustainability, providing users with objective ratings for investment reference.
### 2. Strategy
#### Strategy Publish
DeepGo has built a social platform around strategy. After you import asset data, you can publish it as a strategy.
#### Social to Earn
Users are rewarded for social actions, while strategy creators get mining incentives through social rankings.
#### Play to Earn
DeepGo innovates with a strategy PK gaming, where users vote to decide the winner. Users who participate in PK and voting will be rewarded, and strategy creators who rank top in PK will get mining incentives.
### 3. NFT
#### Reputation NFT
Voyager is a reputation NFT on the basis of users' social and investment behavior on DeepGo. Users are rewarded with DeepGo core tokens for social and investment performance to pay for Voyager's minting and upgrades. The higher the Voyager level, the more privileges the holder has on features and the ability to earn core tokens.
#### NFT Market
Voyager, the reputation credential to the DeepGo platform, is at the heart of the DeepGo token economy. DeepGo will provide a marketplace for trading NFT and related tokens.
## Project Features
### Investment Strategy theme SocialFi
DeepGo builds SocialFi around investment strategies to make Social more functional and deliver higher value. Combining Social to Earn and Play to Earn, users can continuously gain benefits and accumulate skills through simple operations. The establishment of reputation NFT grade let users achieve greater harvest in the investment benefit and personal development during the process of gradually reaching the goal.
### NFT Reputation Economics
In the DeepGo world, NFT is an important piece of identity, affecting value capture and unlocking platform functions. The mining incentives (core tokens) that users get through social networking and investment can be considered as tokenized reputation. Through consuming core tokens, reputational value is minted into NFT by upgrading. The user's skills and reputation NFTs are upgraded simultaneously, and more gains are unlocked, which forms a positive cycle based on reputation.
### Ecosystem Landscape
DeepGo launch features based on how difficult they are to get started, gradually grow and strengthen the community and allow users and the platform to grow in tandem. Currently, rating and strategy are open, with tranche fund and Launchpad to follow. Simple features first, then difficult, and users gradually accumulate skills when upgrading the reputation NFT to prepare for new functions.
