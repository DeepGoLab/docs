## Project Features
### Investment Strategy Driven SocialFi Metaverse
DeepGo is an investment strategy driven SocialFi metaverse, which makes Social more functional and valuable. Combining Social to Earn and Play to Earn, users can continuously gain benefits and accumulate skills through simple operations. The establishment of reputation NFT grades let users achieve greater harvest in the investment benefit and personal development during the process of gradually reaching the goal.
### NFT Reputation Economics
In the DeepGo metaverse, NFT is an important piece of identity, affecting value capture and unlocking of features. The incentives (core tokens) that users get through social and investment can be considered as tokenized reputation. Through consuming core tokens, reputational value is minted into NFT by upgrading. The user's skills and reputation NFTs are upgraded simultaneously, and more gains are unlocked, which forms a positive cycle based on reputation.
### Ecosystem Landscape
DeepGo launch features based on how difficult they are to get started, gradually develop the community and grow with users. Currently, analytics and strategy are open, with tranche funds and Launchpad to follow. Simple features first, then difficult, and users gradually accumulate skills when upgrading the reputation NFT to prepare for new features.
